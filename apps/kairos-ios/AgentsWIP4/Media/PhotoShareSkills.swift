// "Put the newest photo somewhere": step lists, as plain data, that the Phone operator can run with ZERO model
// calls. PhotoAgent saves the photo to the library first, so in every app's picker it is the newest item.
//
// - Labels are the English (UK) labels of each app's current iOS build, as best they could be checked from
//   help pages and guides on 25 Oct 2026. NOTHING here has been calibrated on the demo phone yet: every step says
//   `verified: false`. Dump each screen once (iCTRL page_source) and fix the alias lists, adding rather than
//   replacing, then flip `verified`.
// - Matching follows ScreenDigest.find: case, accents and emoji ignored; exact label first, then "contains".
//   `exact: true` means exact only (so "Send" never matches "Send to…").
// - The final publish tap (Post, Share, Send, Upload, Create link) is always a `.stopBefore` step. The operator
//   finds it, shows the owner what is about to happen, and taps only if the owner policy says yes.
// - Text typed into an app comes only from slots, and slots come only from the person's own words
//   (PhotoAgent checks this). Nothing on the screen is ever typed back or obeyed.

/// One deterministic step.
