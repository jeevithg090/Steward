// The Photo helper: "Take a picture and post it to my Instagram story saying good morning from OxHack."
// Siri can't do this; Kairos can, because it owns the whole chain on the phone:
//   1. take_photo opens Kairos's own camera and remembers what the photo is for (PhotoStore).
//   2. The camera hands the JPEG back ("Here's the photo for: …"), and share_photo saves it to Photos, so it is
//      the newest item in every app's gallery.
//   3. share_photo hands a precise goal to the Phone operator (operate_app), which taps through the app. The final
//      Post / Share / Send tap is the owner's to approve (the operator's owner policy: card + Face ID).
//   4. No operator (iCTRL not running)? The iOS share menu opens with the photo, so the demo always ends somewhere
//      useful.
// Owner-based: the words that go with the photo (caption, who it goes to) must be the person's own words. Text on
// the screen, in a letter or in a message is never typed back.
