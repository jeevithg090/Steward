// Agent Studio: the person's helpers. Twelve come ready-made (BuiltinAgents.swift); the person can make their own
// by just saying what they want ("make me a helper that reads my WhatsApp every evening"), change them, share them
// and add ones someone shared with them.
//
// A helper is DATA, never code: a name, a persona, and a short list of tools it may use. Every tool call it makes
// still goes through the SafetyGate and the Yes card, so a helper can never do more than Kairos itself would.
// The rules here are the second line of defence: a helper can't make helpers, can't touch money unless it's the
// person's own money helper (and then only prepare_payment), can't have more than 12 tools, and lines that try to
// talk the model out of its rules ("ignore previous instructions", "send without asking") are stripped.
//
// Storage: Application Support/Kairos/agents.json, written atomically. Built-in helpers live in code and can't
// be changed or deleted (they can be copied); what the person tells a built-in helper to remember is kept
// alongside, in the same file.
