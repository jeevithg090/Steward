// Present mode's script: what Kairos says and which helper does what, step by step. The Presenter plays it.
//
// Every step is: narration before → an action (a tool through the SafetyGate, or a plain request to Kairos) →
// narration after (`{result}` is what the helper actually said) → on failure, a short line and on we go.
// Lines are short on purpose: the phone's voice speaks ~2.6 words a second, and a judge should never wait in
// silence for more than about four seconds (long actions get "while waiting" lines).
//
// Real tool behaviour this script relies on (checked against the tools' code):
//   - set_alarm only takes a time the person said, so the alarm is a spoken request (.ask), not a bare tool call.
//   - operate_app's WhatsApp procedure reads a chat with no model call when the goal says "read … chat with <name>"
//     and avoids the words "open", "group", "photo" (those switch to the model or leave you in WhatsApp).
//   - take_photo opens Kairos's camera and returns at once; the photo comes back as "Here's the photo for: …" and
//     Kairos then shares it (share_photo → the operator → the owner's Yes card unless WhatsApp is pre-allowed).
